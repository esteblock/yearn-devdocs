# Woofy

The WOOFY token is the blue dog companion token of YFI. Utilizing special Woof technology, it allows two-way conversion between the two tokens, allowing holders to be exposed to YFI in a fluffier package.

At its core, WOOFY solves two problems: YFI not being dog themed, and the price of a single YFI being too high in USD terms.

**1 YFI = 1,000,000 WOOFY**. YFI and WOOFY can always be exchanged with one another at that fixed rate using the [WOOFY Ethereum contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd0660cd418a64a1d44e9214ad8e459324d8157f1#code).
