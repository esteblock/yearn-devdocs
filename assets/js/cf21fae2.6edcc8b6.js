Similar to how bonding curves work, there will then be a significant premium for any additional DAI borrowing (the cost to borrow DAI will be > $1).

This increases the barrier to entry for liquidity providers and also the capital requirements. Single-sided liquidity provisioning will enable LPs to deposit only one of the assets in the liquidity pool (i.e., either ETH or USDC).
